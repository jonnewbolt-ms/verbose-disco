# Copilot Instructions (Repo-wide)

These instructions apply across the repository.

## Always do
- Start from docs/ai-context/README.md for repo context.
- Prefer running a defined process from docs/processes/_registry.md.
- Follow the process' **Output format** and **Quality gates** sections.

## Output expectations
- Use Markdown.
- Include file paths for created/updated artifacts.
- Keep changes minimal and aligned to the process contract.

## Structure conventions
- Process definitions live under docs/processes/<process-id>/process.md
- Steps live under docs/processes/<process-id>/steps/ (ordered)
- Shared blocks live under docs/blocks/
