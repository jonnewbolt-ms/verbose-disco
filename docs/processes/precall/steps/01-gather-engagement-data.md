# Step 01: Gather engagement data

Use WorkIQ to query all upcoming customer engagements in the next month.

Stage the temporary collected information in a scratch directory at
`docs/processes/precall/scratch/` (create it if missing).

Collect for each engagement:
- Customer name
- Topic or engagement title
- Date and duration
- Key attendees (internal and customer-side)
- Internal call status and date (if scheduled)
- Customer call status and date (if scheduled)
- Agenda status (present, missing, high-level overview, not applicable)
- Current status (in progress, scheduled, in planning)
- Notes with relevant context
