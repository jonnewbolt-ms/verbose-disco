# Agent-Orchestrated Process Repo

This repo contains Markdown-based process definitions and instruction files intended to be used by an AI agent (e.g., GitHub Copilot) to execute repeatable workflows.

## Quick start
- Browse available workflows in docs/processes/_registry.md
- Use prompt files in .github/prompts/ to run/list/validate processes
- look in runbooks/how-to-add-a-process.md for more guidance
